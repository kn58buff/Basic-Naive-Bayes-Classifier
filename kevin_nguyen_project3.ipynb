    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is an important machine learning technique with applications in diverse areas, including (but not limited to): making business decisions by analyzing customer reviews, inferring/predicting a government's intents based on their speech or posts, and detecting spam e-mails. To make use of text classification, groups typically obtain a data set containing text as well as one or more categories that each text falls into. For example, a business interested in improving one of their products could obtain all the reviews for that product, where each review has a star rating associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most text classification algorithms are supervised, meaning they use labeled training/test data. Unsupervised algorithms for text classification do exist, but our focus in this project will be the Naive Bayes Classifier, a supervised technique.<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will dive deeper into Naive Bayes before we implement it, but in short it is a probabilistic model driven by Bayes' Theorem<sup>2</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of text classification, let $A$ be a possible category for some text and let $B = (b_1, b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_n)$ be the set of predictors in that text. We can then restate Bayes' Theorem as the probability that a piece of text is in category $y$, given that it has features $b_1, b_2, b_3, \\dots, b_n$, on the assumption that $A$ and $B$ are independent of each other. To be \"independent of each other\" means that any two features $b_i$ and $b_j$ do not affect each other's chances of occurring. This assumption is also where the \"naive\" part comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "For this project, we will be implementing a variation of Naive Bayes: the multinomial Naive Bayes, which is useful when the features are word counts in a data set. To test and analyze the effectiveness of this model, we will use it on two datasets: movie reviews that have been labeled as positive or negative to predict whether a new review is positive or negative, and posts from newsgroups to predict which newsgroup a new post is from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset of movie reviews is already somewhat processed: it comes as a ```.csv``` where each row contains a review and its corresponding rating. On the other hand, the dataset of newsgroup posts is entirely raw: it comes as a ```.txt``` file containing every post and corresponding information about the post (which newsgroup the post is from, the author, and the subject), so some processing must be done there to shape the dataset into a table where each row contains a post and corresponding newsgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, the text in each dataset needs to be processed, as they need to be normalized for the best classification results.<sup>6</sup>"

    "### Preliminary Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will be performing the steps necessary to start classifying text data, but first, we will import the necessary libraries for the entire project, which will mainly be ```pandas``` for reading and working with the data, ```regex``` for cleaning the data using regular expressions, and ```sklearn``` modules for model testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will need to clean the text data. In this context, \"cleaning\" the data will involve removing any irrelevant text and making each entry have the same format. So for example, we will be making the text lower-cased, removing any HTML tags and newline characters, and removing other non-words such as punctuation and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an essential step for classifying text data (and cleaning is essential, in general, for working with any kind of data), because it standardizes the text, makes it easy to break down into its unique words, and reduces variation in text, which help to define it as being of a certain category."

Therefore, we will need to take a look at each dataset individually to better understand what steps need to be taken to produce a clean text."

If so, \\nI will be glad to repost them.  Will you accept that it just may be \\na practice among some Muslims, if I do?

    "\n",
    "Now that we have successfully processed and cleaned both of the datasets we will be working with, our next step is to actually implement Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As was mentioned in the Introduction, what drives Naive Bayes is Bayes' Theorem, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$, and we will be using Multinomial Naive Bayes, instead of the standard Gaussian Naive Bayes.<sup>3</sup> The main difference is that Multinomial Naive Bayes assumes a multinomial distribution of data (which, in this context is how often a word appears in a particular category) and Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes a Gaussian (or normal) distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be doing additional modifications:\n",
    "* Laplace smoothing,<sup>7</sup> which ensures we do not get any zero probabilities.\n",
    "    * There are two cases where we can get a zero probability: the word is not present in one or more of the categories, or the word is completely unknown. We only have to check for the latter case, and if it is true we initialize an array of $0$ to represent the word.\n",
    "    * When the probability is calculated, we are going to add $1$ to the count of the word and then divide by the total number of words in each category plus the number of unique words.\n",
    "        * Why add the number of unique words to the denominator: since we are essentially adding $1$ to each word's count that we encounter, the number of words in each category has increased by the number of unique words.\n",
    "* Taking the log probability. Since we are dealing with probabilities, which are bounded between $0$ and $1$, a problem of underflow may occur because decimals are stored using 64-bits. This means that a very small decimal may be incorrectly represented as $0$. By applying $\\ln$ to each probability, we ensure underflow doesn't happen by mapping the probability to $\\left(-\\infty,0\\right]$ as the log of a small, positive decimal is a large, negative number.\n",
    "    * The natural log preserves order. If $P(A) < P(B)$ then it's also true that $\\ln P(A) < \\ln P(B)$"

    "$$\\text{F1} = \\frac{2PR}{P + R}$$\n",

    "Besides performance, we also want to look at other parts of the data and the algorithm, including: the most frequent words in each class, what classes are misclassified more often than other categories for the newsgroup dataset, and how the training size impacts accuracy."

Even though we removed stopwords, we expect for the movie reviews to have about the same top ten words in both categories, while the newsgroups should vary more between topics that are less related."

    "#### Observations\n",
    "There are words that are present in the top words of all, or most of, the newsgroups, such as \"one\", \"dont\", \"know\", and \"out\". This is to be expected because there are words and phrases that are really common, for example the phrase \"I don't know\".\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important to note is that there are some unique words present in some newsgroups that aren't present in other ones. For example, \"medical\" and \"health\" were found very frequently in ```sci.med```, but doesn't up in the top ten words of any other newsgroup. Likewise, \"jesus\" and \"christian\" show up in ```talk.religion.misc```, but don't show up as often anywhere else except potentially ```alt.atheism```."

    "### Accuracy\n",
    "To examine accuracy we will be using a standard split<sup>8</sup> of $80$% training data and $20$% test data for both datasets. As mentioned previously, we will be using F1 scores to measure accuracy. For the movie reviews, we will have a single F1 score as we are doing binary classification in this case. On the other hand, we will have $9$ F1 scores for the newsgroups dataset, one for each of the newsgroups because we are doing multi-class classification for this dataset and a weighted F1 score that is a weighted average of the eight scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, it would be expected that the classifier performs better on binary classification than multi-class classification because having more classes increases the likelihood of misclassification (i.e., more classes means more possibilities to be incorrect).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice this may not be the case. As we have observed from the previous section, $7$ of the top $10$ \"positive\" words are also found in the top $10$ \"negative\" words, which is a problem because we would like for the words to be unique to each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the newsgroup dataset, the F1 scores of some newsgroups should be very high while others are lower. In particular, if the newsgroups are similar, then they will most likely be misclassified. For example, there is a newsgroup for miscellaneous religious talk and a newsgroup for atheism -- it is clear that both have to do with religion. There are also very unique newsgroups, such as the medical and electronics ones, where it should be expected that the scores for these groups are very high as medical and electronics terminologies should not be appearing in other types of posts as frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we found when we compared the top $10$ words found in each newsgroup category: there was a overlap in newsgroups that were similar and for categories that were unique, there were words in their top $10$ that did not appear in any other categories.\n"

    "#### Discussion of Results\n",
    "Running the classifier on our review test set, we obtained a F1 score of about $0.8460$, which is pretty good considering the variety in the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the newsgroups test set, we obtained a weighted F1 score of about $0.9312$, which is much better than we would have expected for multi-class classification. In fact, this is quite a bit better than the performance on reviews, which may suggest that our hypothesis that the most frequent words used in both types of movie reviews are too similar, to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1 scores of each category, rounded to 4 decimal places, are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```alt.atheism```: $0.8657$,<br>\n",
    "```rec.autos```: $0.9434$,<br>\n",
    "```rec.motorcycles```: $0.9595$,<br>\n",
    "```rec.sport.baseball```: $0.9511$,<br>\n",
    "```rec.sport.hockey```: $0.9717$,<br>\n",
    "```sci.electronics```: $0.9526$,<br>\n",
    "```sci.med```: $0.9521$,<br>\n",
    "```talk.religion.misc```: $0.7964$\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are very much in line with what we expected. ```alt.atheism``` and ```talk.religion.misc```, which both had \"god\" as one of their top words, tended to be misclassified more than the other newsgroups hence their relatively low scores. From the confusion matrix, it can be seen that when the true label was ```talk.religion.misc```, the text was misclassified as ```alt.atheism``` $29$ times, the most of any other newsgroup."

    "### Efficiency: Observed Runtime\n",
    "Using ```tqdm```'s progress bar, we can observe that our function, ```NB_classifier```, runs between $6$ and $7$ iterations per second on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency: Asymptotic Runtime\n",
    "For this section, we will determine the asymptotic runtime of the main parts of our implementation using Big-O notation, which is just a statement of an upper-bound on the runtime of an algorithm (disregarding coefficients) at very large inputs. As an example, $O(n)$ means that an algorithm scales linearly with input size and $O(1)$ means an algorithm runs in constant time (i.e., input size doesn't contribute to runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "By a quick inspection of our code, we mainly use ```numpy``` and built-in Python methods. In general, ```numpy``` operations are optimized for speed so we can assume the operations we used in ```NB_classifier``` are $O(1)$ on average or amortized $O(n)$, thus the runtime scales linearly with how many words are in the piece of text we want to classify and how many possible categories there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let the number of words be denoted by $n$ and the number of possible categories be $c$: the runtime is $O(nc)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtain the word counts by looping through the rows of our dataframe and then looping through the words in each text entry. Taking a look at the code we used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "word_counts_newsgroups = {}\n",
    "for row in train_news.itertuples():\n",
    "    ng = row.newsgroup\n",
    "    for word in row.cleaned_words:\n",
    "        if word not in word_counts_newsgroups:\n",
    "            word_counts_newsgroups[word] = {\n",
    "                'rec.autos': 0, 'sci.med': 0, 'alt.atheism': 0,\n",
    "                'rec.sport.baseball': 0, 'talk.religion.misc': 0,\n",
    "                'rec.sport.hockey': 0, 'sci.electronics': 0,\n",
    "                'rec.motorcycles': 0\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        word_counts_newsgroups.get(word)[ng] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we let the number of rows be $m$ and the number of words in a given row be $k$, then this entire code block has a runtime of $O(mk)$, since ```dict.get``` and adding to a dictionary are both $O(1)$ on average.<sup>5</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our implementation is $O(nc) + O(mk)$, where:\n",
    "* $n$: the number of words in the text to classify\n",
    "* $c$: the number of possible categories\n",
    "* $m$: the size of our training set\n",
    "* $k$: the number of words in our training set\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider that we are only using ```NB.classifier``` multiple times on a dataset, then the amortized runtime of this algorithm must be $O(nc)$, as we compute word counts only once per training set."

    "### Varying Training Size\n",
    "In this section, we analyze how well our classifier does depending on the size of the training set, measured by increases in accuracy. We would also like to determine how marginal these increases are.\n",

    "As discussed in the previous section, our algorithm scales linearly with the size of our training set and the number of words in the target text. For very large datasets that may have millions of entries, the computation of word counts can become significant even though it is only done once. So, if the increase in accuracy is highly marginal between changes in training set size, this begs the question of whether using such a large training set is worth it if the increase in accuracy is small and the trade-off is a longer computation time for word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say at an $80-20$ split we obtain a F1 score of $0.84$, and at a $50-50$ split we obtain a F1 score of $0.82$. And let's say our complete data set has $2.5$ million rows; for the former case we have a training set size of $2$ million and for the latter we have a size of $1.25$ million. Although this example is a little exaggerated, our hypothetical results suggest that adding in $750000$ more data points barely increases the accuracy, which may lead to the $50-50$ split being more favored as it is not as computationally expensive to compute the word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this as our motivation, we will vary training size until we see marginal improvement in F1 scores. Since the classifier did not perform as well as we would have hoped for the movie reviews, this is the dataset we want to investigate and assume that the results generalize to the newsgroup dataset as well."

    "For these specific splits of training and test data, the results we have obtained seem to support the idea that increasing training set size only marginally increases performance of the classifier. The F1 scores we obtained are $0.8529$, $0.8581$. and $0.8578$ for the training splits of $60$, $80$, and $90$ percent, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there was an increase in accuracy between $60$ and $80$ percent, it was a very small increase in performance relative to the increase in training set size. For $80$ and $90$ percent, it is safe to say that the result was pretty much the same - there was a decrease in accuracy but this may have just been due to the data included in either split.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can conclude that, for much larger data sets of movie reviews, it might be more reasonable to train using a $60-40$ split if training time is a concern."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "In this project, we implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and tested various aspects of its performance using two different sets of text data. The first, and arguably more difficult, part of this project was to pre-process and clean the data sets. The movie reviews were already in a tabular format with each row representing a review and corresponding sentiment, while the newsgroups were in a singular text file that required much more processing. During this step of processing the newsgroups file, we made the important choice to filter out incomplete entries: any posts that did not have a newsgroup, author, or subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then had to \"clean\" the data to make each text entry standardized so variation in text could be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of the pre-processing was done, our tests generally suggested that the classifier performed better on classifiying most newsgroups than movie reviews, which ran contrary to our theoretical expectation of the classifier performing better on binary classification than multiclass classification problems, but were more in line with our expectations after observing that many of the most frequent words in ```positive``` reviews were similarly frequent in ```negative``` reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posts from ```talk.religion.misc``` were misclassified as ```alt.atheism``` more often than other newsgroups were misclassified, but as we said previously this is most likely due to how closely related the two topics are (so the most frequent words in both categories could be very similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found that increasing the size of our training data led to marginal improvements, at least between a $60-40$ split and an $80-20$ split, so if people are concerned about time it may be more beneficial to use a smaller training set split and see if accuracy is still high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to other areas of exploration, we should observe the classifier's performance on other binary and multiclass text classification problems and compare their results to determine if the classifier is, in general, more accurate for putting text into two categories than more than two categories. We also want to test other kinds of text besides movie reviews and forum posts, so for example we could look at problems involving tweet sentiment, email spam, or customer support tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve results, we could see if (and where) the cleaning of our text data fell short and fix up those areas. The accuracy of any classifier when dealing with text classification problems is highly dependent on the data being well-formatted. One of the biggest things we did not do was lemmatization,<sup>6</sup> which is considering the context of the word and turning a word into its base form. For example, \"running\" would turn into \"run\" and \"caring\" would turn into \"care\". This part of the cleaning process combines words that are essentially the same word by transforming them into their base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the biggest drawback of the Naive Bayes Classifier is its assumption that every predictor is independent of every other predictor which is why it is \"naive\". In the case where this assumption is true, the classifier produces very accurate probabilities, but if the assumption is false then the probabilities break down and cannot be trusted for accuracy. For example, if we are trying to predict having a heart attack based on high blood pressure and previously having a stroke, then we know that the predictors (high blood pressure, stroke history) are not independent because high blood pressure is a factor in having a stroke. In cases such as this, it might be better to use other classifiers or prediction methods."
